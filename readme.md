# ATS Recruitment BE built using Django & sqlite

I'd build REST API server for basic ATS for recruiters.

Here Candidates can create their application form, Recruiter can shortlist or reject the candidate form. Also I'd used JWT Login Authentication system.

Recruiter Login: -
username:  recruiter1@gmail.com
password: Recruiter@123#

Here recruiters can filter/search for specific candidates based on expected salary, age, years of exp more than, phone number, email or name.

Also I'd created one Name search API that has a relevance based sorting.
